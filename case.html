    <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>My Pokedex App is a Javascript application that pulls from the PokeApi from pokeapi.co to display images and various states of pokemon.
</p>


<h3>Purpose & Context</h3>
<p>Pokedex App was a personal project I built as part of my web development course at <br>CareerFoundry to demonstrate my knowledge of Javascript, DOM interaction and use of APIs.<br> It also was my first go with using JQuery and Bootstrap. I personally am a huge fan of Pokemon<br> and because the franchise is so diverse with so many 'characteristics' of each creature, <br> Pokemon makes a perfect API to have various snippets of info to pull from and use for an application. <br> Believe it or not, a lot of Pokemon fans love to learn things like height and weight of their favorite poke-partner.</p>


<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>
The aim of the project was to have an working application that could be used in my portfolio to show skill in using various<br> functions in Javascript, using UI patterns, <br>extracting data from APIs and use JS Libraries.

  <h2>Approach</h2>

  <h3>API</h3>
  <p>I used the RESTful API (Application Programming Interface ) from https://pokeapi.co/ to pull information needed for various pokemon info,<br> such as images and stats. I used Ajax principals to fetch <br> the image and stats of various 150 pokemon from the API. This way I would have <br> fun information to display in the modal!

  <h3>Modal</h3>
  <p>Using both the Javascript library jQuery to create methods to pull the API information, I also used the UI framework bootstrap<br> to make a nice looking modal to display the information pulled from the API. Users would just have to <br> click on the name of their desired Pokemon and have a window pop up with their image and stats. </p>

  <h2>Takeaways</h2>
  <h3>Challenges</h3>
  <p>
    Since this was my first time learning Javascript and the various components that can go into a JS application, I found the jump from a mark up language <br>like HTML to an actual coding language like JS jarring. In the beginning I was having trouble understanding<br> how functions are used and how to implement ajax and fetch the data needed <br> to display. I was able to figure out how to successfully complete the project with help from self-studying the jQuery & ajax documentation, along with <br> guidance from my mentor and tutor.
  </p>
  <h3>Duration</h3>
  <p>The development of the project in total took about two months to complete. Most of my time was spent trying to get the modal <br> to display the information about a particular pokemon when clicked on by a user. This is due to not completely getting the<br> hang of functions and promises in JS.  </p>
  <h3>Thoughts</h3>
  <p>Even though by most standards this is a pretty simple application, I am very proud I was able to complete<br>my first Javascript application. I helped me cement that if I kept at it, I would eventually <br> work out the bugs and find solutions to produce a nice looking, functioning application.</p>
