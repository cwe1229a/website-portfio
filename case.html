    <h2>Overview</h2>
<p>My Pokedex App is a Javascript application that pulls from the PokeApi from pokeapi.co to display images and various states of pokemon.
</p>


<h3>Purpose & Context</h3>
<p>Pokedex App was a personal project I built as part of my web development course at CareerFoundry to demonstrate my knowledge of Javascript, DOM interaction and use of APIs.<br> It also was my first go with using JQuery and Bootstrap.</p>


<h3>Objective</h3>
<p>
The aim of the project was to have an working application that could be used in my portfolio to show skill in using various functions in Javascript, using UI patterns, <br>extracting data from APIs and use JS Libraries.

  <h2>Approach</h2>

  <h3>API</h3>
  <p>I used the RESTful API from https://pokeapi.co/ to pull information needed for various pokemon info, such as images and stats. I used Ajax principals to fetch <br> the image and stats of various 150 pokemon from the API.
  </p>

  </div>
  <h3>Modal</h3>
  <p>Using both the Javascript library jQuery to create methods to pull the API information, I also used the UI framework bootstrap<br> to make a nice looking modal to display the information pulled from the API.  </p>

  <h2>Takeaways</h2>
  <h3>Challenges</h3>
  <p>
    Since this was my first time learning Javascript and the various components that can go into a JS application, I found the jump from a mark up language <br>like HTML to an actual coding language like JS jarring. In the beginning I was having trouble understanding how functions are used and how to implement ajax and fetch the data needed <br> to display. I was able to figure out how to successfully complete the project with help from self-studying the jQuery & ajax documentation, along with <br> guidance from my mentor and tutor.
  </p>
  <h3>Duration</h3>
  <p>The development of the project in total took about two months to comlete. Most of my time was spent trying to get the modal <br> to display the information about a particular pokemon when clicked on by a user.  </p>
